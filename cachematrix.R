## This file contains two functions that create a special object that stores
## a numeric matrix and caches its inverse using the solve() function.
## The function assumes that the matrix supplied is invertible.

## This function creates a special object that stores a numeric matrix
## and can also store the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This funtion checks to see if the inverse of this matrix is already
## cached and if not it calculates the inverse and caches it

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
